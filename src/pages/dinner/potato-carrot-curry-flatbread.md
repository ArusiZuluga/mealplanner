Recipe for 4 people

## Ingredients

* 2﻿ onions
* 5 cloves of garlic
* 4﻿00 gr winter carrot
* 5﻿00 gr potatoes
* 4﻿0 gr fresh ginger
* 1﻿5 gr fresh coriander
* 1﻿ tsp ground coriander
* 2﻿00 gr red lentils
* 4﻿00 gr canned peeled tomatoes
* 4﻿50 ml hot water
* 2﻿00 gr wholemeal wheat flour
* 1﻿.5 tsp baking powder
* 1﻿25 ml of water



## Preparation

1. Chop the onions, finely chop 2 cloves of garlic. Peel the carrots and cut into 1 cm cubes. Peel the potatoes and cut into 2 cm cubes. Peel the ginger and cut as finely as possible. Coarsely chop the coriander leaves and finely chop the stems.


2. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fruit the onion glassy in this. Add the finely chopped garlic, ginger and ground coriander and fry for 2 minutes.

3. Rinse the lentils. Add the lentils, tomatoes, coriander stalks, potatoes and hot water to the onion mixture. Season with salt if necessary. Lower the heat and cook for 20 minutes with the lid on the pan. After 15 minutes, add the carrots and stir.

4. Meanwhile, mix the flour and baking powder in a bowl. Add the cold water and 2 tbsp oil. Grate the rest of the garlic on top. As soon as the dough starts to feel stiff, briefly knead it into a ball by hand. Add 1 tsp water if the dough is too crumbly or 1 tbsp flour if it is too sticky. Put it in a bowl, cover with a tea towel and let it rest for 10 minutes in a warm place. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and roll into balls. Roll them out into oval pieces of 1⁄2 cm thick on a floured work surface. Heat a frying pan without oil or butter over medium heat. Bake the flatbreads for 6-8 minutes until cooked through and starting to have dark bubbles. Turn halfway. Meanwhile, remove the lid from the frying pan and let the curry cook for another 6 minutes.
